-- ANALYZE CUSTOMER SPENDING PATTERNS

-- JOINED VIEW: customer orders with product and payment details
-- Purpose:
-- This query joins all five tables (customers, orders, order_items, products, payments) into one rich view.

-- It tracks what each customer bought, how much they spent, and how they paid.

-- Filters for only "Completed" orders ensures only fulfilled transactions are analyzed.
-- Key Transformation:
-- (oi.quantity * pr.price) calculates the total amount spent per product in each order.

-- Purpose:
-- Calculates Lifetime Value (LTV) for each customer = total money spent on completed orders.

-- CTE (WITH) modularizes the logic so you can reuse or extend it later (e.g., for segmentation).

-- ORDER BY + LIMIT shows top 10 highest-value customers.
